This is where I get my theme from as it is the prefered way to install

I need to run make html in the docker container

The theme needs to be at the location sepecifed in the docker-compose file for it to get properly mounted

https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex
That is my theme github repo

http://localhost:8000/pages/contact-me.html
Is the current local url of the website

## Build and deployment steps

Generate the site with the command `pelican content` in the container

Deploy changes to master with the following command in the container when on the develop branch
`ghp-import -b master output`

Change to the local master branch and push that branch

Github should automatically deploy those changes

## Common issues:
If I change files in the container they will not be owned by my user. To fix this:
`sudo chown -R username .` Outside the development container.
